|- COMPILING -|
The provided Makefile will build the two executables "oss" and
    "user_proc"
Simply run "make" and the two  executables will be outputted.
    See the USAGE section below to see how to run the programs.
A cleaning function is provided. run "make clean" to clean up
	the directory and leave only src behind.


|- USAGE -|
The "oss" executable is intended to simulate memory management on an operating
    system using LRU replacement.

The oss executable takes one argument to specify the number of children to spawn
[-p num] The number of children processess to run with 

The user-proc excutable is run by oss. It is not intended to be run alone.
    However, it takes one argument from oss. This being the following:
[-p pid] The simulated pid of the process


|- FUNCTIONALITY -|
The oss executable will generate a number of children processes. And add
them to a schedule queue. It then runs these processes by selection from the
queue.

|- KNOWN ISSUES/LIMITATIONS -|
